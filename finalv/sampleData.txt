The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (stylized as iPhone 12 mini) are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the fourteenth-generation, lower-priced iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11. They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on October 13, 2020, alongside the higher-end iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max flagships. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone became available in most countries on October 23, 2020. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone became available on November 13, 2020.

The major upgrades over the iPhone 11 include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone 11 and XR, 5G support, the introduction of MagSafe, Apple A14 Bionic system on a chip (SoC), high-dynamic-range video Dolby Vision 4K up to 30 fps and a new Mini model. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini, like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models from Apple to no longer include a power adapter or EarPods headphones found in prior iPhone models; however, a USB-C to Lightning cable is still included; and this change was retroactively applied to other iPhone models sold by Apple, such as the iPhone 11 and the second iPhone SE.
